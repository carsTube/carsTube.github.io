CarsTube is single page application for cars. There is login/register functionality, functionality for all the CRUD operations. You can publish new ads, search for ads, use filters to choose how you want the ads to appear. For the app I have not used framework, I have used some libraries like 'page', 'jquery', 'lit-html' and other. For back-end I use Back4App. Other things you can do when you login/register is liking ads and ratings ads which are not published by you. Note that if you try to rate the same ad multiple times the previous rating from you will be updated, so there is no way to give 2 ratings to the same ad. For the likes it is a little bit different - you can unlike the ad after you liked it. When you go to home page and scroll down you will see the 2 most recent added ads. When logged in you can check the ads you have uploaded and edit them or delete them if you want. For deployment I have used GitHub Pages.
